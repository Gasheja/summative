    <h1 style="text-align: center">Renewable Energy</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      There are several renewable sources of energy. Some of them are discussed
      below:

          <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
          <p>
            Solar energy is captured from sunlight using photovoltaic (PV) cells
            in solar panels or solar concentrators. These cells convert sunlight
            directly into electricity. Solar power is versatile and can be used
            for small-scale applications, such as powering homes or devices, as
            well as large-scale solar farms that feed electricity into the grid.
            Advances in solar technology, such as solar battery storage, have
            increased its reliability, allowing energy to be stored for use when
            the sun isn’t shining.<br /><b>Benefits:</b><br />
            Abundant, widely available, low environmental impact.<br />
            <b>Limitations:</b> Requires sunlight, so its effectiveness can be
            reduced in cloudy areas or during nighttime.

        <div>
          <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
          <p>
            Wind energy is generated by wind turbines that convert the kinetic
            energy of wind into mechanical power, which is then converted into
            electricity. Wind farms can be onshore or offshore, with offshore
            turbines benefiting from stronger and more consistent winds. Wind
            power is one of the fastest-growing sources of renewable energy
            worldwide, particularly in regions with strong wind patterns.<br />

            <b>Benefits:</b> Clean, renewable, and cost-effective in the long
            run.<br />
            <b>Limitations:</b> Wind is intermittent, requiring backup systems,
            and turbines can sometimes impact local wildlife (such as birds).

      <section class="section">
        <div>
          <h2>Hydropower</h2>
          <p>
            Hydropower harnesses the energy from flowing water (usually rivers
            or water released from reservoirs) to generate electricity. The most
            common form is the use of dams, which store water in a reservoir and
            release it through turbines to produce power. Smaller-scale
            "run-of-the-river" projects divert some of a river’s flow to
            generate electricity without needing large dams.<br />

            <b>Benefits:</b> Reliable, consistent, can produce large amounts of
            power.<br />
            <b>Limitations:</b> Large dams can disrupt local ecosystems, fish
            populations, and human communities, and can be vulnerable to
            drought.

        <div>
          <h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
          <p>
            Geothermal energy taps into the Earth’s internal heat, found beneath
            the Earth's surface, to generate electricity or provide heating.
            This heat can be used directly (as in geothermal heating systems) or
            can be converted into electricity through geothermal power plants,
            which pump hot water or steam to drive turbines.<br />

            <b>Benefits:</b> Reliable, operates continuously (not dependent on
            weather conditions), low emissions.<br />
            <b>Limitations:</b> Geothermal plants are location-specific,
            requiring areas with high geothermal activity (e.g., volcanic
            regions), and there is potential for minor seismic disturbances.
